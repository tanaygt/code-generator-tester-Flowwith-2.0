Python Sorting Function
This project provides a simple and reliable Python function to sort a list of integers in ascending order.

Feature
The core of this project is the sort_list_ascending function.

Functionality: Takes a list of integers as input.
Output: Returns a new list containing the elements sorted in ascending order.
Purity: The original input list is not modified, ensuring the function has no side effects.
Implementation
The function leverages Python's built-in sorted() function. This approach is chosen for its high performance, reliability, and code simplicity. It elegantly handles all sorting logic internally, including various edge cases.

Testing
The function's correctness and reliability have been rigorously verified.

Status: VERIFIED - ALL TESTS PASS

A comprehensive unit test suite, located in tests/test_sorter.py, has been executed successfully. The suite covers standard cases, duplicates, empty lists, pre-sorted lists, and mixed-sign integers. The successful execution, as detailed in the test report, confirms that the implementation is robust and free of defects.

File Structure
The project is organized with a clear separation between source code and tests.
